# SortingAlgorithmsLibrary
A library of sorting algorithms written in C#.

This project is meant to help me get a better understanding of the various sorting algorithms typically employed by programmers, mathmeticians and scientists alike.

If anyone finds use for it in your own project please feel free to download it and implement it however you see fit. I've included a testing project just in case to ensure that all the algorithms are working to spec.

Enjoy.
